        This project began as part of an academic assignment where four dudes had to create a web app that consumed an API. After brainstorming a bunch of different ideas, the concept to build a video game database quickly stole the spotlight, and they never looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
        What began as a simple class project soon evolved into a vision for the ultimate online video game resource. What you see now is just the beginning of a something they hope will one day become the go-to hub for gamers everywhere and leave a lasting mark on the world of gaming.

        Without further ado, meet the original fourHorsemen...

    <h5>Pestilence, a.k.a. CodeMonkeyDan:</h5>
    <p>
        Dan has loved video games for as long as he can remember, spanning several decades. He recalls playing classics like <em>Frogger</em>, <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Asteroids</em>, <em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>Berzerk</em>, <em>Cosmic Ark</em>, <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>, and <em>Football</em> on the Atari 2600. But it was the Nintendo Entertainment System that truly solidified his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then, he’s been loyal to consoles, especially Nintendo and Sony. Some of his favorite franchises include <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</em>, <em>Gran Turismo</em>, <em>Mario Kart</em>, and <em>Madden NFL</em>. His favorite game of all time? That is a tough decicion, but it would probably be <em>Skyrim</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        While he doesn’t have as much time for gaming as he used to, they can still take him to that special place when he gets the chance. Outside of gaming, he enjoys spending time with his family, being outdoors, hanging out on the lake, and fishing. He’s also into slot car racing and football. His favorite team? The Buffalo Bills. And yes, he still holds out hope that he will get to witness them hoist the Lombardi trophy before he dies. "Be Good, Do Good, God Bless, and Go Bills!"

    <h5>Death, a.k.a. SUPARedBeard, a.k.a. Josh:</h5>
    <p>
        Video games have always been a massive part of Josh’s life. As a ’90s kid, his journey started in a pretty unusual way, his grandma had an Atari 2600 tucked away in the spare room. The first game he ever played? <em>Sneak 'n Peak</em>. It wasn’t exactly a masterpiece, but it sparked a lifelong love for video games.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first console to magically appear in his home was a SNES, though its life was cut short after he accidentally spilled Sprite on it and tried drying it in the dryer (RIP). His first true gaming love, however, was the Sega Genesis. He’d fake being sick just to stay home and play classics like <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, <em>ECCO the Dolphin</em>, <em>Cool Spot</em>, <em>Comix Zone</em>, and <em>Mickey Mouse: Castle of Illusion</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        From there, a PS1 magically spawned with iconic games like <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>, <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>Spyro</em>, <em>Tomb Raider</em>, and a stack of demo discs that got more play than the full games ever did. But it was the PS2, with <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> and <em>Guitar Hero</em>, and later the Xbox 360 with <em>Halo 3</em> that solidified gaming as a core part of his identity.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Today, Josh spends his time catching up on legendary titles he missed—especially <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, while also keeping up with the endless stream of new releases. He’s especially drawn to franchises like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em>, <em>BioShock</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, skateboarding games, and just about anything that drops on Xbox Game Pass.
    </p>
    <p>
        His all-time favorites? <em>Kingdom Hearts 2</em>, <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em>, <em>Guitar Hero</em>, and <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Josh’s love for gaming has also inspired passions beyond the controller: building custom PCs, modding retro consoles in every way imaginable, skateboarding, and diving into music and movies inspired by gaming culture. Now a father of two, he’s passing that love on, teaching his kids how to shred in <em>Sonic</em>, master the art of <em>Guitar Hero</em>, ride a skateboard, and appreciate what makes a great movie. And of course, he still dreams of the day the Panthers beat the Bills in the Super Bowl.

    <h5>War, a.k.a. YoungRager, a.k.a. Jared:</h5>
    <p>
        Jared was introduced to video games at a young age through his cousins, although he didn’t have a console of his own until the PlayStation 2 came out. That console changed everything—it transformed his view of gaming from a fun pastime into a true appreciation for it as an art form. Titles like the <em>Sly Cooper</em> trilogy and <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> helped cement the PS2 as one of his favorite consoles of all time.
    </p>
    <p>
        These days, Jared owns every relevant console—except for an Xbox, which he substitutes with a solid gaming PC—and stays on top of new releases that catch his interest. He has a passion for pain, as his favorite genre is the brutally difficult but deeply rewarding world of soulslikes. FromSoftware games especially have his heart, with <em>Elden Ring</em> standing tall as his favorite game of all time. It’s the unforgiving combat, the high stakes, and the feeling of overcoming the impossible that keep him coming back—even after rage-quitting a few times along the way.

    <h5>Famine, a.k.a. DeuceMaccoy, a.k.a. Phillip:</h5>
    <p>
        Phillip got his start in video gaming when his father brought home a Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. He’s played his fair share of platformers and action titles, but his true love lies in roleplaying games and real-time strategy. Growing up, he whet his appetite with the standard lineup of consoles—NES, SNES, PlayStation, and so on. While he dabbled in a few Sega games, that console never really captured his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
        These days, Phillip’s passion is firmly rooted in PC gaming. Whether he’s fighting to survive in horror games like <em>The Forest</em> or building vast empires in traditional RTS titles like <em>Civilization</em> and <em>Endless Legend</em>, one thing’s for sure—he gets his rocks off by building a home (or an empire) that can weather any storm. And once it’s built, that home (or empire) will be defended—ruthlessly.
